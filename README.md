As I'm progressing with the development of this model, I have uploaded some Python codes so you can already see code for review.
I will appriciate all PR and change suggentions.

Before you running the code you should download the training sets of the images:

`./download_train_assets.sh`

That will help you to download a training data of diffrenet images (1.2g)

Once the images downloaded you should verify that the folder that created here is images_data/training,
when verified you can continue to run `python train.py`
